# Hey, I'm Chandler 👋

Frontend-focused full-stack engineer who genuinely loves the craft of polished, intuitive UI.

I build software that saves people time, with a strong focus on **thoughtful UX** and making complex work feel effortless.

### What I Care About

- **Design that delights** — interfaces that feel intuitive, not just functional
- **Simplifying complexity** — design systems, component architecture, intuitive UX
- **AI / LLM tooling** — agents and workflows that actually do useful work
- **Accessibility** — good software works for everyone

### Currently Tinkering With
